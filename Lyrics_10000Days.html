    "Vicarious"<br /><br />

    Eye on the TV<br />
    'cause tragedy thrills me<br />
    Whatever flavour<br />
    It happens to be like;<br />
    Killed by the husband<br />
    Drowned by the ocean<br />
    Shot by his own son<br />
    She used the poison in his tea<br />
    And kissed him goodbye<br />
    That's my kinda story<br />
    It's no fun 'til someone dies<br /><br />

    Don't look at me like<br />
    I am a monster<br />
    Frown out your one face<br />
    But with the other<br />
    Stare like a junkie<br />
    Into the TV<br />
    Stare like a zombie<br />
    While the mother<br />
    Holds her child<br />
    Watches him die<br />
    Hands to the sky crying<br />
    Why, oh why?<br />
    'cause I need to watch things die<br />
    From a distance<br /><br />

    Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br />
    You all need it too, don't lie<br /><br />

    Why can't we just admit it?<br />
    Why can't we just admit it?<br /><br />

    We won't give pause until the blood is flowing<br />
    Neither the brave nor bold<br />
    The writers of stories sold<br />
    We won't give pause until the blood is flowing<br /><br />

    I need to watch things die<br />
    From a good safe distance<br /><br />

    Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br />
    You all feel the same so<br />
    Why can't we just admit it?<br /><br />

    Blood like rain come down<br />
    Drawn on grave and ground<br /><br />

    Part vampire<br />
    Part warrior<br />
    Carnivore and voyeur<br />
    Stare at the transmittal<br />
    Sing to the death rattle<br /><br />

    La, la, la, la, la, la, la-lie<br /><br />

    Credulous at best your desire to believe in<br />
    Angels in the hearts of men<br />
    Pull your head on out<br />
    Your head believes it give a listen<br />
    Shouldn't have to say it all again<br />
    The universe is hostile<br />
    So impersonal<br />
    Devour to survive, so it is<br />
    So it's always been<br /><br />

    We all feed on tragedy<br />
    It's like blood to a vampire<br /><br />

    Vicariously I, live while the whole world dies<br />
    Much better you than I<br />

    "Jambi"<br /><br />

    Here from the king's mountain view<br />
    Here from the wild dream come true<br />
    Feast like a sultan I do<br />
    On treasures and flesh, never few.<br />

    But I, I would wish it all away.<br />
    If I thought I'd Lose you just one day.<br /><br />

    The devil and his had me down,<br />
    in love with the dark side I'd found.<br />
    Dabble in all the way down<br />
    up to my neck soon to drown.<br /><br />

    But you changed that all for me.<br />
    Lifted me up, turned me round.<br />
    So I...<br />
    I...<br />
    I...<br />
    I...<br />
    I would<br />
    I would<br />
    I would<br />
    Wish this all away<br /><br />

    Prayed like a father dusk to dawn.<br />
    Beg like a hooker all night long.<br />
    Tempted the devil with my song.<br />
    And got what I wanted all along.<br /><br />

    But I,<br />
    And I would,<br />
    If I could,<br />
    And I would,<br />
    Wish it away,<br />
    Wish it away,<br />
    Wish it all away,<br />
    Wanna wish it all away,<br />
    No prize that could hold sway,<br />
    Or justify my giving away,<br />
    my center.<br /><br />

    So if I could I'd wish it all away.<br />
    If I thought tomorrow would take you away.<br />
    You're my peace of mind, my home, my center.<br />
    I'm just trying to hold on,<br />
    One more day.<br /><br />

    Dim my eyes...<br />
    Dim my eyes...<br /><br />

    Dim my eyes if they should compromise<br />
    our fulcrum what you need divides me then<br />
    I might as well be gone.<br /><br />

    Shine on forever.<br />
    Shine on benevolent son.<br /><br />

    Shine down upon the broken.<br />
    Shine until the two become one.<br /><br />

    Shine on forever.<br />
    Shine on benevolent son.<br /><br />

    Shine on upon the severed.<br />
    Shine until the two become one.<br /><br />

    Divided I'm withering away.<br /><br />

    Divide and I'm withering away.<br /><br />

    Shine on upon the many, light our way<br />
    Benevolent son.<br /><br />

    Breathe in union.<br />
    Breathe in union.<br />
    Breathe in union.<br />
    Breathe in union.<br />
    Breathe in union.<br />
    So as one survive.<br />
    Another day and season.<br /><br />

    Silence leech, and save your poison.<br />
    Silence leech, and stay out of my way.<br />

    You believed.<br />
    You believed in moments not conceived.<br />
    You believed in me.<br /><br />

    A passionate spirit.<br />
    Uncompromise.<br />
    Without us in your heart.<br />
    A light in your eyes that, ends all lies.<br /><br />

    Vacant, broken.<br />
    Fell at the hands of<br />
    Those moments that I wouldn't see.<br />
    Cause it was you who prayed for me so.<br />
    What have I done to be a son to an angel?<br />
    What have I done to be worthy?<br /><br />

    Day light dims leaving cold fluorescence.<br />
    Difficult to see you in this light.<br />
    Please forgive this selfish question, but<br />
    What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?<br /><br />

    She never told a lie.<br />
    Well might of told a lie.<br />
    But never lived one.<br />
    Didn't have a life.<br />
    Didn't have a life.<br />
    But surely saved one.<br />
    Saved on.<br /><br />

    Alright, now it's time for us to let you go.<br />

    "10,000 Days(Wings Pt 2)"<br /><br />

    We listen to the tales and romanticize,<br />
    how we follow the path of the hero.<br /><br />

    Boast about the day when the rivers overrun,<br />
    How we'll rise to the height of our halo.<br /><br />

    Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,<br />
    our way into the arms of the savior.<br />
    Fading all the trials and the tribulations.<br /><br />

    None of us have actually been there,<br />
    Not like you...<br /><br />

    The ignorant fibbers in the congregation.<br />
    Gather around spewing sympathy,<br />
    Spare me...<br /><br />

    None of them can even hold a candle up to you.<br />
    Blinded by choices,<br />
    hypocrites won't see.<br /><br />

    But enough about the collective Judas.<br />
    Who could deny you were the one who illuminated?<br />
    Your little piece of the divine.<br /><br />

    This little light of mine it gives your past unto me,<br />
    I'm gonna let it shine<br />
    to guide you safely on your way.<br /><br />

    Your way home...<br /><br />

    Oh, what are they gonna do when the lights go down?<br />
    Without you to guide them all to Zion?<br />
    What are they gonna do when the rivers overrun?<br />
    Other than tremble incessantly.<br /><br />

    High is the way,<br />
    but our eyes are upon the ground.<br />
    You are the light and the way.<br />
    They'll only read about.<br />
    I only pray heaven knows,<br />
    when to lift you out.<br /><br />

    10,000 days in the fire is long enough.<br />
    You're going home...<br /><br />

    You're the only one who can hold your head up high.<br />
    Shake your fist at the gates saying,<br />
    "I have come home now...!"<br />
    Fetch me the spirit, the son and the father.<br />
    Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.<br /><br />

    "It's time now!<br />
    My time now!<br />
    Give me my<br />
    Give me my wings...!"<br /><br />

    Give me my [x5]<br /><br />

    (Give me my wings)<br /><br />

    You are the light, the way,<br />
    that they will only read about.<br /><br />

    Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.<br />
    Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.<br />
    You were my witness, my eyes, my evidence,<br />
    Judith Marie, unconditional one.<br /><br />

    Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.<br />
    Difficult to see you in this light.<br />
    Please forgive this bold suggestion.<br />
    Should you see your maker's face tonight,<br />
    Look him in the eye.<br />
    Look him in the eye and tell him,<br />
    I never lived a lie, never took a life,<br />
    But surely saved one.<br /><br />

    Hallelujah<br />
    It's time for you to bring me home.<br />

    Lost Keys<br />
    [voices fading in]<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] Excuse me? Doctor? Do you have a moment?<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] A moment? What's the question?<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] What's the problem?<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] That is the problem, we're not sure.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] You got the chart?<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] Right here.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] Not much here to say<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] Name?<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] No sir.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] Did someone drop him off?<br />
    Maybe we could speak to them.<br />
    Let's get some background on this fella.<br /><br />

    [Nurse:] No ID. Nothing<br />
    [heavy breathing in background]<br />
    And he won't speak to anybody.<br /><br />

    [Doctor:] Well, let's say hello.<br />
    Good Morning, I'm Dr. Lawson.<br />
    How are you today? How - are - you today?!<br />
    Look son, you're in a safe place.<br />
    We wanna help in whatever way we can.<br />
    But you need to talk to us.<br />
    We can't help you otherwise.<br />
    What's happened? Tell me everything.<br /><br />

    Alright then, picture this if you will:<br />
    10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes,<br />
    in my "need to know" pose, just outside of Area 51.<br />
    Contemplating the whole "chosen people" thingy when a flaming<br />
    stealth banana split the sky like one would hope but never really<br />
    expect to see in a place like this.<br />
    Cutting right angle donuts on a dime and stopping right at my Birkenstocks,<br />
    and me yelping...<br />
    Holy fucking shit!<br /><br />

    Then the X-Files being,<br />
    looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan<br />
    with Isabella Rossellini lips and breath that reeked of vanilla Chig Champa,<br />
    did a slow-mo Matrix descent out of the butt end of the banana vessel and hovered above my bug-eyes,<br />
    my gaping jaw, and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip and all I could think was:<br />
    "I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice that I pissed my fuckin' pants."<br /><br />

    So light in his way,<br />
    Like an apparition,<br />
    He had me crying out,<br />
    "Fuck me,<br />
    It's gotta be,<br />
    Deadhead Chemistry,<br />
    The blotter got right on top of me,<br />
    Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!"<br /><br />

    And after calming me down with some orange slices and some fetal spooning,<br />
    E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose.<br />
    He said, "You are the Chosen One, the One who will deliver the message.<br />
    A message of hope for those who choose to hear it and a warning for those who do not."<br />
    Me. The Chosen One?<br />
    They chose me!!!<br />
    And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school.<br /><br />

    You better.<br />
    You better.<br />
    You better.<br />
    You better listen.<br /><br />

    When he looked right through me<br />
    With somniferous almond eyes.<br />
    Don't even know what that means<br />
    Must remember to write it down.<br />
    This is so real.<br />
    Like the time he floated away.<br />
    See my heart is pounding,<br />
    'Cause this shit never happens to me.<br /><br />

    Can't breathe, right now!<br />
    It was so real.<br />
    Like I woke up in Wonderland.<br />
    All sort of terrifying.<br />
    And I don't wanna be all alone when I tell this story.<br />
    And can anyone tell me why<br />
    It was a repeat experience<br />
    Will I ever be coming down?<br />
    This is so real.<br />
    Finally it's my lucky day.<br />
    See my heart is racing,<br />
    'Cause this shit never happens to me.<br /><br />

    Can't breathe, right now!<br /><br />

    You believe me, don't you?<br />
    Please believe what I just said, see they're telling true.<br />
    And this wasn't all in my head.<br />
    See they took me by the hand and invited me right in,<br />
    Then they showed me something.<br />
    I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />

    STRAPPED DOWN MY BED. FEET COLD AND EYES RED.<br />
    I'M OUT MY HEAD. AM I ALIVE, AM I DEAD?<br />

    The details of our ending.<br />
    To write it down for all the world to see.<br />
    But I forgot my pen,<br />

    And where there's one<br />
    they're bound to divide it,<br />
    Right in two.<br />
    Right in two.<br /><br />

    Monkey killing monkey killing monkey.<br />
    Over pieces of the ground.<br />
    Silly monkeys give them thumbs.<br />
    They make a club.<br />
    And beat their brother, down.<br />
    How they survive so misguided is a mystery.<br /><br />

    Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven conscious of his fleeting time
    here.<br /><br />

    Cut it all right in two [x4]<br /><br />

    Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky<br />
    Fight over life, over blood, over prayer,<br />
    overhead and light<br />
    Fight over love, over sun,<br />
    over another, Fight...<br /><br />

    Angels on the sideline again.<br />
    Been soon long with patience and reason.<br />
    Angels on the sideline again<br />
    Wondering when this tug of war will end.<br /><br />

    Cut it all right in two [x3]<br />
    RIGHT IN TWO!<br /><br />

    Right in two...<br />
