    "Stinkfist"<br /><br />

    Something has to change.<br />
    Undeniable dilemma.<br />
    Boredom's not a burden anyone should bear.<br />
    Constant over stimulation numbs me<br />
    But I would not want you any other way.<br />
    Just not enough.<br />
    I need more.<br />
    Nothing seems to satisfy.<br />
    I said, I don't want it.<br />
    I just need it.<br />
    To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.<br /><br />

    Finger deep within the borderline.<br />
    Show me that you love me and that we belong together.<br />
    Relax, turn around and take my.<br /><br />

    I can help you change tired moments into pleasure.<br />
    Say the word and we'll be well upon our waaay.<br />
    Blend and balance pain and comfort deep within you<br />
    till you will not want me any other way.<br />
    But it's not enough.<br />
    I need more.<br />
    Nothing seems to satisfy.<br />
    I said, I don't want it.<br />
    I just need it.<br />
    To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.<br /><br />

    Knuckle deep inside the borderline.<br />
    This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.<br />
    Relax. Slip awaaaaaaaay.<br /><br />

    Chupa minha pica pichu<br />
    Chupa minha pica pinto<br /><br />

    Something kinda sad about,<br />
    the way that things have come to be.<br />
    Desensitized to everything.<br />
    What became of subtlety?<br /><br />

    How can it mean anything to me,<br />
    if I really don't feel a thing at all?<br /><br />

    I'll, keep, digging<br />
    till I, feel, something.<br /><br />

    Elbow deep inside the borderline.<br />
    Show me that you love me and that we belong together.<br />
    Shoulder deep within the borderline.<br />
    Relax, turn around and take my hand. <br />

    He had alot of nothing to say.<br />
    (We'll miss him. 2x)<br />
    He had alot to say.<br />
    He had alot of nothing to say.<br />
    (We'll miss him. 2x)<br />
    (We're gonna miss him. 2x)<br /><br />

    So loooooong!<br />
    We wish you well.<br />
    You told us how you weren't afraid to die.<br />
    Well so looooooong.<br />
    Don't cryyyyy.<br />
    Or feel too down.<br />
    Not all martyrs see divinity.<br />
    But at least you tried.<br /><br />

    Standing above the crowd<br />
    he had a voice that was strong and loud.<br />
    (We'll miss him. 2x)<br /><br />

    Ranting and pointing his finger<br />
    at everything but his heart.<br />
    (We'll miss him. 2x)<br />
    (We're gonna miss him. 2x)<br /><br />

    No wayyyyyy<br />
    to recall<br />
    what it was that you had said to me,<br />
    like I care at alll.<br />
    But he was sooo louuud.<br />
    You sure could yell.<br />
    You took a stand on every little thing<br />
    and soooo louuuuuuuuud.<br /><br />

    You, could be, the one, who saves, me from, my own, existence.<br /><br />

    Standing above the crowd,<br />
    he had a voice that was strong and loud<br />
    and I swallowed his facade cuz I'm so eager to identify<br />
    with someone above the ground,<br />
    someone who seemed to feel the same,<br />
    someone prepared to lead the way,<br />
    with someone who would die for me.<br /><br />

    Will you?<br />
    Will you now?<br />
    Would you die for me?<br />
    Don't you fuckin' lie.<br />
    (Don't you step out of line! 3x)<br />
    Don't you fuckin lie.<br /><br />

    You've claimed all this time<br />
    that you would die for me.<br />
    Why then are you so surprised<br />
    when hear your own eulogy?<br />
    (He had alot to say.<br />
    He had alot of nothing to say. 2x)<br /><br />

    Coome down.<br />
    Get off your fuckin cross.<br /><br />

    We need the fuckin space<br />
    to nail the next fool martyr!<br /><br />

    To ascend you must die!<br />
    You must be crucified<br />
    for your sins and your lies!<br />
    Goodbyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyye!<br />

    What's coming through is alive.<br />
    What's holding up is a mirror.<br />
    But what's singing songs is a snake<br />
    looking to turn my piss to wine.<br />
    They're both totally void of hate,<br />
    but killing me just the saaame.<br />
    The snake behind me hisses what my damage could have.<br />
    My blood before me begs me open up my heart again.<br />
    And I feel this coming over like a storm again.<br />
    Considerately.<br /><br />

    Venomous voice,<br />
    tempts me,<br />
    drains me,<br />
    bleeds me,<br />
    leaves me cracked and empty.<br />
    Drags me down like some sweet gravityyyyyyyy.<br /><br />

    The snake behind me hisses what my damage could have been.<br />
    My blood before me begs me open up my heart again.<br />
    (And I feel this coming over like a storm again. 2x)<br /><br />

    I am too, connected to you<br />
    to slip away,<br />
    to fade away.<br />
    Days away I still feel you<br />
    touching me,<br />
    changing me,<br />
    and (considerately killing me. 4x)<br /><br />

    Without the skin here,<br />
    beneath the storm,<br />
    under these tears now,<br />
    the walls came down.<br />
    As the snake is drowned<br />
    and as I look in his eyes,<br />
    my fear begins to fade<br />
    recalling all of the times.<br />
    I could have cried then.<br />
    I should have cried then.<br /><br />

    And as the walls come down<br />
    and as I look in your eyes<br />
    my fear begins to fade<br />
    recalling all of the times<br />
    I have died,<br />
    and will die.<br />
    It's all right.<br />
    (I don't mind. 2x)<br />
    I dont' minnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd!<br /><br />

    I am too connected to you<br />
    to slip away,<br />
    to fade away.<br />
    Days away I still feel you<br />
    touching me,<br />
    changing me,<br />

    Digging through<br />
    My old numb shadow<br /><br />

    My shadow's<br />
    Shedding skin<br />
    and I've been picking<br />
    scabs again.<br />
    I'm down<br />
    digging through<br />
    my old muscles<br />
    for a clue.<br />
    I've been crawling on my belly<br />
    clearing out what could've been.<br />
    I've been wallowing in my own confused<br />
    and insecure delusions<br />
    for a piece to cross me over<br />
    or a word to guide me in.<br />
    I wanna feel the changes coming down.<br />
    I wanna know what I've been hiding<br />
    in (my shadow. 2x)<br />

    feel the outside turning in.<br />
    I wanna feel the metamorphosis and<br />
    cleansing I've endured in,<br />
    (my shadow. 2x)<br />
    Change is coming.<br />
    Now is my time.<br />
    Listen to my muscle memory.<br />
    Contemplate what I've been clinging to.<br />
    Forty-six and two ahead of me.<br /><br />

    I,<br />
    choose to live and to,<br />
    grow,<br />
    take and give and to,<br />
    move,<br />
    learn and love and to,<br />
    cry,<br />
    kill and die and to,<br />
    be,<br />
    paranoid and to,<br />
    lie,<br />
    hate and fear and to,<br />
    do,<br />
    what it takes to move through.<br /><br />

    I choose to live and to,<br />

    what it takes to step through.<br /><br />

    See my shadow changing,<br />
    stretching up and over me<br />
    soften this old armor.<br />
    Hoping I can clear the way by<br />
    stepping through my shadow,<br />
    coming out the other side.<br />
    Step into the shadow.<br />
    Forty six and two<br />
    are just ahead of me. <br />

    What was it like to see<br />
    the face of your own stability<br />
    suddenly look away<br />
    leaving you with the dead and hopeless?<br />
    Eleven and she was gone.<br />
    Eleven is when we waved good-bye.<br />
    Eleven is standing still,<br />
    (whispers) waiting for me<br />
    waiting for me to free him by<br />
    coming hooooooooome.<br />
    Moving me with a sound.<br />
    Opening me within a gesture.<br />
    Drawing me down and in,<br />

    showing me where it all began,<br />
    Eleven.<br /><br />

    (I/He/It) was too scarred to realize<br />
    that you are the voice that's been calling me back hoooooooome.<br />
    Under a dead Ohio sky,<br />
    Eleven has been and will be waiting<br />
    defending his light and wondering...<br />
    where the hell have I been?<br />
    Sleeping, lost, and numb. I'm<br />
    so glad that I have found you.<br />
    I am wide awake and heading,<br />
    home.<br /><br />

    (there's more than this, but it's mostly indistinct) Just for me, kill the light<br /><br />

    Hold your light Eleven.<br />
    Lead me through each day of memory.<br />
    Hold your light,<br />
    Hold your light,<br />
    Hold your light where I can see<br /><br />

    Hoooooooooooooooooome!<br /><br />

    Hold your light,<br />
    Eleven. Lead me through each gentle<br />
    step, by step<br />
    by inch by loaded memory.<br />
    I'll move to heal<br />
    as soon as pain allows<br />
    so we can reunite<br />
    and both move on together.<br />
    Hold your light,<br />

    Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still.<br />
    Followed by millions of dumbfounded dipshits.<br />

    -Bill Hicks:See I think, drugs have some done good things for us.<br />
    I really do.<br />
    And if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us.<br />
    Do me a favor, go home tonight,<br />
    take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your CDs, and burn them.<br />
    'Cause you know what?<br />
    The musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years?<br />
    Reeeeeeeal fucking high on drugs.-<br /><br />

    -Today young men on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed<br />
    to a slow vibration, that we are all one conciousness experiencing itself subjectively,<br />
    there is no such thing as death, life is only dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves.<br />
    Here's Tom with the weather.-<br /><br />

    -It's not a war on drugs, it's a war on personal freedom is what it is, okay?<br />
    Keep that in mind at all times, thank you.-<br /><br />

    Dreaming of that face again.<br />
    It's bright and blue and shimmering.<br />
    Grinning wide and comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes.<br /><br />

    On my back and tumbling<br />
    down that hole and back again<br />
    rising up and wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye.<br /><br />

    (indistinct)<br />
    In Out In Out<br />
    Innnnnnnnnn!<br /><br />

    (6:52)<br />
    -A child's rhyme stuck in my head.<br />
    It said that life is but a dream.<br />
    I've spent so many years in question,<br />
    to find I've known this all along.-<br /><br />

    "So good to see you.<br />
    I've missed you so much.<br />
    So glad it's over.<br />
    I've missed you so much.<br />
    Came out to watch you play.<br />
    Why are you running away?<br />
    Came out to watch you play.<br />
    Why are you running?"<br /><br />

    -Shrouding all the ground around me.<br />
    Is this holy crow above me.<br />
    Black as holes within a memory<br />
    and blue as our new second sun.<br />
    I stick my hand into his shadow<br />
    to pull the pieces from the sand.<br />
    Which I attempt to reassemble<br />
    to see just who I might have been.<br />
    I do not recognize the vessel,<br />
    but the eyes seem so familiar.<br />
    Like phosphorescent desert buttons<br />
    singing one familiar song... -<br /><br />

    (Prying open my third eye. 4x)<br /><br />

    So good to see you once again.<br />
    I thought that you were hiding.<br />
    And you thought that I had run away.<br />
    Chasing the tail of dogma.<br /><br />

    (Opened my eye 3x) And there we were (Opened my eye 3x) And there we were<br /><br />

    So good to see you once again<br />
    I thought that you were hiding from me.<br />
    And you thought that I had run away.<br />
    Chasing a trail of smoke and reason.<br /><br />
