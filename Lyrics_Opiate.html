    "Sweat"<br /><br />

    I'm sweating,<br />
    and breathing<br />
    and staring and thinking<br />
    and sinking<br />
    deeper.<br />
    It's almost like I'm swimming.<br /><br />

    The sun is burning hot again<br />
    on the hunter<br />
    and the fisherman,<br />
    and he's trying to remember when,<br />
    but it makes him dizzy.<br /><br />

    Seems like I've been here before.<br />
    Seems so familiar.<br />
    Seems like I'm slipping<br />
    into a dream within a dream.<br /><br />

    Must be the way you whisper.<br /><br />

    The sun is setting cool again.<br />
    I'm the thinker<br />
    and the fisherman<br />
    and I'm trying to remember when<br />
    but it makes me dizzy.<br />
    and I'm sweating,<br />
    and breathing, <br />
    and staring and thinking<br />
    and sinking<br />
    deeper<br />
    and it's almost like I'm swimming.<br /><br />

    Seems like I've been here before.<br />
    Seems so familiar.<br />
    Seems like I'm slipping<br />
    into a dream within a dream.<br />
    It's the way you whisper.<br />
    It drags me under<br />
    and takes me home.<br />

    "Part Of Me"<br /><br />

    I know you well.<br />
    you are a part of me.<br />
    I know you better than I know myself.<br />
    I know you best,<br />
    better than anyone.<br />
    I know you better than I know myself.<br /><br />

    You don't judge.<br />
    You can't speak.<br />
    You can't leave.<br />
    You can't hurt me.<br />
    You're just here for me to use.<br /><br />

    I know you best,<br />
    better than one might think.<br />
    I know you better than I know myself.<br />
    It's time for you<br />
    to make a sacrifice.<br />
    It's time to die a<br />
    little.<br />
    Give it up.<br /><br />

    You are a part of me.<br />

    "Cold And Ugly"<br /><br />

    Underneath her skin and jewelry,<br />
    hidden in her words and eyes<br />
    is a wall that's cold and ugly<br />
    and she's scared as hell.<br />
    Trembling at the thought of feeling.<br />
    Wide awake and keeping distance.<br />
    Nothing seems to penetrate her.<br />
    She's scared as hell.<br /><br />

    I am frightened to.<br /><br />

    Wide awake <br />
    and keeping distance from my soul.<br />
    I am scared like you.<br />

    "Jerk-Off"<br /><br />

    Use to be a bunch of assholes that lived in this part of the building here,<br />
    but we systematically removed them like you would any kind of termite or roach<br /><br />

    Someone told me once <br />
    that there's a right and wrong,<br />
    and that punishment<br />
    would come to those<br />
    who dare to cross the line.<br /><br />

    But it must not be true<br />
    for jerk-offs like you.<br />
    Maybe it takes longer to catch a total asshole.<br />
    but I'm tired of waiting.<br />
    Maybe it's just bullshit and I should play GOD,<br />
    and shoot you myself.<br />
    Because I'm tired of waiting.<br /><br />

    Consequences dictate<br />
    our course of action<br />
    and it doesn't matter what's right.<br />
    It's only wrong if you get caught.<br />
    If consequences dictate<br />
    my course of action<br />
    I should play GOD <br />
    and shoot you myself.<br />
    I'm very tired of waiting.<br /><br />

    I should<br />
    kick you,<br />
    beat you, <br />
    fuck you,<br />
    and then shoot you in your fucking head.<br />

    I had a friend once he took some acid<br />

    It's okay until he pisses on your lighter<br />
    Kinda smells kinda cool kinda funny anyway<br /><br />

    satan, satan, satan...<br /><br />

    I had a friend once he took some ecstasy<br />
    Tried to marry me and every one in the room<br />
    He was sort of loving kinda caring, <br />
    kinda tried to fuck my lazy boy<br />
    It got a bit messy all over the curtains,<br />
    arm chair covers, throw pillows, and carpeting<br /><br />

    satan, satan, satan...<br /><br />
