    "Third Eye (intro)"<br /><br />

    Think for yourself<br />
    Question authority<br /><br />

    Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening,<br />
    terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in<br />
    this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the<br />
    religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by<br />
    giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their<br />
    view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and<br />
    learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness;<br />
    chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself.<br /><br />

    Think for yourself.<br />
    Question authority.<br /><br />

    "Pushit (intro)"<br /><br />

    (Maynard's monologue:)<br /><br />

    We've been trying something<br />
    a little different this tour.<br />
    We've been looking at<br />
    one of our songs<br />
    from a different angle,<br />
    under a different light,<br />
    so we can hopefully kind of<br />
    see it almost for the first time.<br />
    We'd like try that for you tonight, is that okay?<br /><br />

    We're gonna need your help though.<br />
    We're gonna need your help<br />
    and your permission,<br />
    so we need you to find<br />
    a comfortable space,<br />
    that is not only comfortable,<br />
    but vulnerable.<br />
    I want you to shut your eyes and go there,<br />
    and we'll meet you on the other side..<br /><br />

    Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone<br />
    Inside sleeping, my heart beating<br />
    You know that you tried to hide it<br />
    Couldn't you have said what you meant? Oh...<br /><br />

    Time heals, time congeals around us<br />
    Endless hours of wasted moments<br />
    Understanding, not demanding<br />
    Your eyes tell what you feel inside<br /><br />

    Setting sun can't shine, now you're gone<br />
    Inside sleeping, my heart beating<br />
    You know that you tried to hide it<br />
    Shouldn't you have said what you meant?<br /><br />

    YOU LIED!<br />
