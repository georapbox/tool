    "The Grudge"<br /><br />

    Wear your grudge like a crown of negativity.<br />
    Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.<br />
    Desperate to control all and everything.<br />
    Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.<br /><br />

    Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.<br />
    Justify denials and grip it to the lonesome end.<br />
    Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.<br />
    Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.<br />
    Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled agaiiiiin.<br />
    I'm born againnnn....<br /><br />

    Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.<br />
    Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.<br />
    Saturn ascends, comes round again.<br />
    Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage dooooone.<br /><br />

    Wear your grudge like a crown of negativity.<br />
    Calculate what you will or will not tolerate.<br />
    Desperate to control all and everything.<br />
    Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.<br />
    Wear the grudge like a crown.<br />
    Desperate to control.<br />
    Unable to forgive. And sinking deeper.<br /><br />

    Defining, confining, sinking deeper.<br />
    Controlling, defining, and we're sinking deeper.<br /><br />

    Saturn comes back around to show you everything<br />
    Let's you choose what you will not see and then<br />
    Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again<br />
    Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.<br />
    Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child<br />
    or drags you down like a stone to<br />
    Consume you till you choose tooooooo, let this goooooooo.<br />
    Choose tooooooo, let this gooooooo.<br /><br />

    Give away the stone. Let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor.<br />
    Give away the stone. Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold.<br /><br />

    Let gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!<br /><br />

    (repeating quietly and fading in)<br />
    Let go!<br />

    (vocalizing)<br /><br />

    A groan of tedium escapes me, startling the fearful.<br />
    Is this a test?<br />
    It has to be. Otherwise I can't go on.<br />
    Draining patience, drain vitality,<br />
    this paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little ooold.<br /><br />

    But I'm still right here, giving blood, keeping faith. And I'm still right here.<br />
    But I'm still right here, giving blood, keeping faith. And I'm still right heeeeeeeere.<br /><br />

    I must keep reminding myself of this... (repeats continually in background...<br /><br />

    "Schism"<br /><br />

    I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away<br />
    mildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing,<br />
    pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion<br />
    disintegrating as it goes testing our communication<br />
    the light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so<br />
    we cannot see to reach an end crippling our communicatioooon.<br /><br />

    I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down<br />
    no fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to<br />
    point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.<br />
    To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communicatioooon.<br /><br />

    The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,<br />
    And the circling is worth it.<br />
    Finding beauty in the dissonance.<br /><br />

    There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.<br />
    Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting<br />
    I've done the the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing<br />
    Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communicatioooon.<br /><br />

    cold, cold, cold,<br />
    Cold silence haaaas<br />
    a tendency toooo<br />
    atrophy anyyyyy<br />
    sense of compassiooooon.<br /><br />

    between supposed loverrrs<br />
    between supposed brotherrrrrs.<br /><br />

    So familiar and overwhelmingly warm<br />

    Embracing you, this reality here,<br />
    This one, this form I hold now, so<br />
    Wiide eyed and hoopeful.<br /><br />

    Wiide eyed and hoopefully wild.<br />
    We barely remember what came before this precious moment,<br />
    Choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside...<br />
    This body holding me, reminding me that I am not alone in<br />
    This body makes me feel eternal. All this pain is an illuuuusion.<br />

    Black then white are, all i see in my infancy.<br />
    Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.<br />
    Lets me see.<br /><br />

    As below, so above and beyond, I imagine<br />
    drawn beyond the lines of reason.<br />
    Push the envelope. Watch it bend.<br /><br />

    Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.<br />
    Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must<br />
    Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.<br /><br />

    Black then white are, all i see in my infancy.<br />
    red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.<br />
    lets me see<br />
    there is so much more and beckons me<br />
    to look thru to these infinite possibilities.<br />
    As below, so above and beyond, I imagine<br />
    drawn outside the lines of reason.<br />
    Push the envelope. Watch it bend.<br /><br />

    Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.<br />
    Withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind.<br /><br />

    Feed my will to feel this moment, urging me to cross the line.<br />
    Reaching out to embrace the random.<br />
    Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.<br /><br />

    (I embrace myyy desire to 2x)<br />
    feel the rhythm, to<br />
    feel connected,<br />
    enough to step aside and,<br />
    weep like a widow, to<br />
    feel inspired, to<br />
    fathom the power, to<br />
    witness the beauty, to<br />
    bathe in the fountain, to<br />
    swing on the spiral, to<br />
    swing on the spiral, to<br /><br />

    swing on the spiral of<br />
    our divinity and<br />
    still be a humannnnnnnnn<br /><br />

    With my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in.<br />
    I feel it move across my skin.<br />
    I'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.<br />
    what ever will bewilder me.<br />
    And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.<br />
    We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.<br />
    (Spiral out. Keep going. 4x)<br />

    (3:43)<br />
    I have come curiously close to the end, down<br />
    Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole.<br />
    Defeated, Concede and move closer. I may find comfort here<br />
    I may find peace within the emptiness.<br />
    How pitiful.<br />
    (It's calling meee. 3x)<br />
    It's calling meeeeee<br /><br />

    And in my darkest moment, fetal annnnd weeeeping.<br />
    The moon tells me a secret.<br />
    My confidant.<br />
    As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own<br />
    A million light reflections<br />
    pass over me<br />
    It's source is bright and endless. She resuscitates the hopeless.<br />
    Without her we are lifeless satellites driiiiiifting.<br />
    And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt<br />
    Don't want to peer down here serving my narcissism<br />
    I must crucify the ego before it's far too late<br />
    I pray the light lifts me out<br />
    (before I pine awaaaay. 3x)<br />
    pine away.<br />
    before I pine awaaaaaaaay.<br /><br />

    (8:48)<br />
    So crucify the ego before it's far too late<br />
    To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical<br />
    And you will come to find that we are all one mind<br />
    Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.<br />
    Just let the light touch you and let the words spill through<br />
    Just let them pass right through, bringing out our hope and reason.<br /><br />

    before we pine away. pine away<br />
    before we pine away. pine away<br />
    before we pine away. pine away<br />
    before we piiiiiine away.<br />

    I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and... (chokes)<br />
    I've kind of been running across the country.<br />

    They are not what they claim to be.<br />
    Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment, particularly the Area 51.<br />
    The disasters that are coming, they, the military, I'm sorry, the government knows about them.<br />
    And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving the population to now.<br />
    They are not!<br />
    They want those major population centers wiped out so that the few that are left will be more easily
