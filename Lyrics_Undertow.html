    I don't want to be, hostile.<br />
    I don't want to be, dismal.<br />
    But I don't want to, rot in,<br />
    an apathetic existance.<br />
    See I want to, believe you,<br />
    and I want to, trust you,<br />
    and I want to have, faith to,<br />
    put away the dagger.<br />
    But (you lie, cheat, and steal. 3x)<br />
    And yet I toleraaate you.<br />
    But (you lie, cheat, and steal.3x)<br />
    And yet I toleraaaaaate you.<br /><br />

    Veil of, virtue, hung to,<br />
    hide your, method, while I,<br />
    smile and, laugh and, dance and,<br />
    sing your, praise and, glory.<br />
    Shroud of, virtue, hung to,<br />
    mask your, stigma, as I,<br />

    (you lie, cheat, and steal. 3x)<br />
    How can I toleraaaaate you?<br />
    (You lie, cheat, and steal. 3x)<br />
    How can I toleraaaaaaaaaate you?<br />
    Our guilt, our blame, I've been<br />
    far too sympathetic.<br />
    Our blood, our fault. I've been<br />
    far too sympathetic.<br />
    (I am not innocent. 2x)<br />
    You are not innocent.<br />
    No one is innocennnt!<br /><br />

    It took so long to remember just what happened.<br />
    I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me,<br />
    but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive,<br />
    even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.<br />
    I've got my haaands bound, my heeead down,<br />
    my eyyyes closed, and my throat's wide open.<br />
    (Do unto others what has been done to you. 2x)<br />
    I'm treading water, I need to sleep a while.<br />
    My lamb and martyr, you look so precious.<br />
    Won't you, won't you come a bit closer,<br />
    close enough so, I can smell you.<br />
    I need you to feel this,<br />
    I can't stand to burn too long.<br />
    Released in this sodomy.<br />
    For one sweet moment I am whooooole.<br /><br />

    (Do unto you now what has been done to me. 2x)<br />
    You're breathing so I guess you're still alive<br />
    even if signs seem to tell me otherwise.<br />
    Won't you, won't you come just a bit closer,<br />
    close enough so I can smell you.<br />
    I need you to feel this.<br />
    I need this to make me whole.<br />
    Release in this sodomy.<br />
    For (I am your witness that blood and flesh can be trusted 2x).<br />
    And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind.<br /><br />

    Got your haaands bound, your heeeead down,<br />
    and your eyyyes closed. You look so precious now.<br /><br />

    I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this<br />
    shit blood and cum on my hands.<br />
    I've, come, round, full circle.<br /><br />

    My lamb and martyr, this will be over soon.<br />

    There's a shadow just behind me,<br />
    shrouding every step I take,<br />
    making every promise empty,<br />
    pointing every finger at me.<br />
    Waiting like a stalking butler,<br />
    who upon the finger rests.<br />
    Murder now the path called must we,<br />
    just because the son has come.<br />
    (Jesus, won't you fucking whistle,<br />
    something but the past and done? 2x)<br />
    Why can't we not be sober?<br />
    Just want to start this over.<br />
    Why can't we drink forever?<br />
    I just want to start things over.<br /><br />

    I am just a worthless liar.<br />
    I am just an imbecile.<br />
    I will only complicate you.<br />
    Trust in me and fall as well.<br />
    I will find a center in you.<br />
    I will chew it up and leave,<br />
    I will work to elevate you,<br />
    just enough to bring you down.<br />

    My compassion is broken now.<br />
    My will is eroded now,<br />
    and my desire is broken now<br />
    and it makes me feel ugly.<br />
    I'm on my knees and burning.<br />
    My piss and moans are the fuel that,<br />
    set my head on fire.<br />
    So smell my soul is burning.<br />
    I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy.<br />
    And I have swallowed the poison you feed me...<br />
    but I survive on it, and it leaves me<br />
    guilt, fed,<br />
    hatred fed,<br />
    weakness fed..<br />
    and it makes me feel ugly.<br />
    On my knees and burning.<br />
    My piss and moans are the fuel that<br />
    set my head on fire.<br />
    I'm dead insiiiiiiiiiiiiide!<br /><br />

    Shit adds up at the bottooom...<br /><br />

    -Henry Rollins: If I let you, you would make me destroy myself.<br />
    But in order to survive you, I must first survive myself.<br />
    I can sink no further and I cannot forgive you.<br />
    There's no choice but to confront you, to engage you, to erase you.<br />
    I've gone to great lengths to expand my threshold of pain.<br />
    I will use my mistakes against you. There's no other choice.<br />
    Shameless now. Nameless now. Nothing now. No one now.<br />
    But my soul must be iron cause my fear is naked. <br />
    I'm naked and fearless.-<br /><br />

    And my fear is nakeeeeeeeeed!<br /><br />

    (Deead iinsiide. 4x)<br />

    I've been struck dumb by a voice that<br />

    It's twice as clear as heaven,<br />
    and twice as loud as reason.<br />
    It's deep and rich like silt on a riverbed,<br />
    and just as neverending.<br />
    The current's mouth below me,<br />
    opens up around me.<br />
    Suggests and beckons all while swallowing.<br />
    It surrounds, and drowns, and sweeps me awaaaaaaaaay.<br />

    -And the angel of the Lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.<br />
    And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.<br />
    And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest.<br />
    And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil.<br />
    One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possesed me then.<br />
    And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"<br />
    And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!<br />
    You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."<br />
    And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,<br />
    "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul!<br />
    Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"<br />
    Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.-<br /><br />

    -It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then.<br />
    That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.<br />
    When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky.<br />
    You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.<br />
    Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this.<br />
    You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.<br />
    Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this.<br />
    You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk,<br />
    waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.<br />
    You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.<br />
    "If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin."<br />
    Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?<br />
    You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked.<br />
    It was a red car and it was new.<br />
    There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.<br />
    Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.<br />
    You began to walk towards them.<br />
    Now red was your color and, of course,<br />
    those little people out there were yours too.-<br />
